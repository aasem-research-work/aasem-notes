This is a simplified SRS outline. Please work closely with your software development team to further refine and expand upon these requirements based on your specific needs and goals. Once you have finalized the SRS, it will serve as a foundation for your software development project.

If you have any specific details or changes you'd like to make to this SRS, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.
